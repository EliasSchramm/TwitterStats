# TwitterStats
 
A fully automated twitter-trend tool.

## How does it work?

The twitter-api has an feature called "Sampled Stream". That means that you get a small live portion of, if you can trust the documentation, ca. 1% of all tweets pushed to twitter. 
This allows us to get a good overview of the current situation on twitter. All Hashtags, Tags and Emoji are relevant bc. everything that we can find, in a sampled stream, multiple in one hour is probably relevant.
These trends and other stats then replace placeholders on a HTML file that then gets copied to the /www/ of an apache2 server. It also saves the top 200 in a list every minute.

## Setup

You want to setup this script yourself? Do so! Here you can find anything you need.

#### Requirements

You need a few thing before you start. <br>

1. Python3 and PIP3 is required to run this script <br>
2. The "Emoji", "Schedule" and "Requests" Libraries are required. ```pip3 install emoji && pip3 install requests && pip3 install schedule```
3. An installation of Apache2. ```apt-get install apache2``` 
4. Screen so we can run the script in the background. ```apt-get install screen``` 
5. A texteditor. I'm using nano. ```apt-get install nano``` 

Note: You can use any webserver you want.

#### Installation

1. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/EliasSchramm/TwitterStats.git```
2. Edit "main.py" ```nano main.py``` 
    - Change the "KEY" variable to your BAERER TOKEN
    - Save the file
3. Edit "start.sh" and "run.sh"
    - Change the directory to the one you cloned to
    - Save the file
4. Make "start.sh" and "run.sh" executable. ```chmod +x start.sh run.sh```
5. Move my stylesheet to the web directory. ``` mv test.css /var/www/html/```
6. Run it! ```./start.sh```
7. You are done and if anything is configured correctly you should see the a website when calling your server.

#### Website

You can customize the website shown however you like! Even while the script is running! Just put the dummy you can see in the table instead of a value.
